# Sports Analytics Using Python
     """In this project, I have compared data of three biggest names of Indian Cricket Team MS Dhoni , Virat Kohli & Rohit Sharma by using Python. Python has data visualizing and data analysing tools such as matplotlib & panda which made my work so easy. I have also done the web scrapping of webpage "cricinfo statsguru" by using beautiful soup(web scraping tool).
